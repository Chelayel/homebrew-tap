# Homebrew formula for AI Relay. The release workflow fills in the version and
# checksums and attaches the result to each release as `airelay.rb`; copy that
# into a tap (a repo named `homebrew-tap`, under Formula/) and users install with
#
#   brew install chelayel/tap/airelay
#
# A formula, not a cask, on purpose: Homebrew does not quarantine what a formula
# downloads, so the unsigned launcher runs without a Gatekeeper dialog.

  # Homebrew only writes under its own prefix, so it cannot remove an airelay
  # that another route installed — install.sh's in ~/.local/bin, the .pkg's in
  # /Applications, the .deb's in /opt — and the first of those usually comes
  # before Homebrew's bin on PATH, so the old copy keeps running after a
  # successful install. Say so, with the command that fixes it.

      airelay is also installed another way. Whichever comes first on your PATH
      is the one that runs, so remove the one you no longer want:
        #{others.join("\n  ")}
      Then run `hash -r` and check with `type -a airelay`.
